Revit Models
============

Here is a collection of Revit models.

The oldest ones include a three.js scene object.

The newer ones (since September 2014) do not. They only contain objects, so that they can be eaasily mixed and merged with other models.

However, that means that no lights are defined and everything apperars as black until a scene and lights are defined.

The following three are very simple test cases:

- wall_2015.rvt.js -- just a wall
- wall_brick.rvt.js -- just a brick wall, added material
- little_house.rvt.js -- a very minimal house: four walls, a floor, a roof, a door and two windows

The following six are the standard sample models included in a basic Revit installation:

- rac_advanced_sample_project.rvt -- Architectural advanced
- rac_basic_sample_project.rvt -- Architectural basic
- rme_advanced_sample_project.rvt -- HVAC advanced
- rme_basic_sample_project.rvt -- HVAC basic
- rst_advanced_sample_project.rvt -- Structural advanced
- rst_basic_sample_project.rvt -- Structural basic
