# Revit glTF Exporter

This is a modified fork of the [RvtVa3c Github Project](https://github.com/va3c/RvtVa3c) ([credit to Matt Mason & Jeremy Tammik](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com)). It is currently a work in progress but the end goal is to create an open source implementation of an extensible exporter from Autodesk Revit to the glTF model format.

## Current To-Do's
- Handle material export
- Add option to export colors only, or full Autodesk materials.
- Add toggle for exporting each element as a seperate .bin vs a single .glb.
- Add element properties to extension on glTF nodes.
- Remove human readable debug export (json).
